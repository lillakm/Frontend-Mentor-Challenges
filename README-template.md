## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Since the first coding challenge with Front End Mentor, I've been using grid to center the component.
I want to add a small learning for each project, so this is the first one when I'm actually filling in the README file. I'll strive to do the same with every upcoming project.

### Continued development

I looked up how to add the effect to the buttons on hover. As this is a beginner challenge, I decided not to bother with at the moment.
I may come back later and complete that part as well.
